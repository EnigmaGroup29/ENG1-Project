                <h3 id="one">About</h3>
                <p>Deep Space Y is a space station on the outskirts of the galaxy, inhabited by humans and
                different species of aliens. You are Auber, the constable of the station, and your job is to
                enforce law and order. The space station has been recently infiltrated by a team of eight hostile
                operatives whose mission is to sabotage key systems of the station and render it inoperable.
                When a sabotage attempt is reported somewhere in the station, you are notified, and you need
                to get there as quickly as possible, arrest the perpetrator, and beam (teleport) them to the brig.
                Infiltrators have different special abilities that can make them difficult to arrest: one can become
                invisible for a short period of time, one can cause you to experience temporary hallucinations.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Auber&quot; is a single-player game, the aim of which is to arrest the infiltrators before they
                manage to destroy a critical number of key systems of the station. 
                The game is won when all eight infiltrators have been arrested. It is lost when
                infiltrators have successfully destroyed more than 15 systems of the space station.
