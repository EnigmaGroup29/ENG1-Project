The working directory for the game to function correctly must be Auber/core/assets in your launch config for your IDE.

To launch the Demo you must be in a non-paused running game and press "P" and a video of a demo round will be launched. This video can be put on repeat if needed while the game is automaticly paused. To continue playing you must tab back in.
