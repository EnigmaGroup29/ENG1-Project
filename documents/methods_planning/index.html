                <h3 id="three">Justification of communication methods</h3>
                <h4>Discord</h4>
                <p>We chose to use Discord for general communication and text messaging as it has a lot 
                of useful features such as voice/text communication as well as creating specific channels 
                for different parts of the project. We chose it over other, similar services such as Slack because 
                most of the team has more experience with Discord. Additionally, the features that Discord doesn't 
                provide will likely be unused, unhelpful to the project.</p>
                <h4>Email</h4>
                <p>We are using Email to communicate with Lecturers to arrange Customer meetings and 
                also to setup initial communication between our team members. In addition, messages 
                that have been sent and received can be stored and searched through safely and easily.</p>
                <h4>Zoom</h4>
                <p>We are using Zoom as it allows us to have contact with the Lecturers (Customers) 
                while in a Practical session. It also has the options to chat, share screen, 
                documents and whiteboard - everything needed for team meetings</p>
                <h4>Google Drive</h4>
                <p>Google Drive provides an easy way to collaboratively work on files as a team and 
                be able to see changes live. It provides an option to create a safe backup of our 
                files and documentation on edits and changes made over time. It also allows us to 
                control the level of access to shared documents.</p>
                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <p>Used to host the code for the game. This service stores files in Git repositories, 
                allowing for version control and collaborative work. It also has an issue tracker 
                that allows us to flag issues to be fixed and discussed among other features</p>

                <h3 id="four">Justification of tools used</h3>
                <h4>Game engine</h4>
                <p>The game engine we have decided to use is called LibGDX. We are using this game 
                engine because it provides an open source framework for the game to be built on 
                providing some of the important features that we require as well as having multiple 
                tutorials for its use online.</p>
                <h4>Gradle build tools</h4>
                <p>Build tools are used to automate the building of the software and manage 
                dependencies (such as the game engine library), among other reasons. We decided to use 
                Gradle because we will likely use libgdx which is designed for this build system. 
                Originally, we decided on Maven because some of the members of our group had used it 
                previously. However, their experience wasn’t extensive enough for this to be considered 
                and as a result, we decided to use Gradle, considering the game engine.</p>
                <h4>IDE of choice</h4>
                <p>The IDE that each team member uses doesn't matter much as long as it has modern 
                tooling and supports our chosen build system, however IntelliJ or Eclipse have been recommended.</p>

                <h3 id="five">Team organisation</h3>
                <h4>Team roles</h4>
                <ul class="b">
                    <li>Michael Beal - Team leader and all deliverables except implementation</li>
                    <li>Lucas Solomon - Architecture and website</li>
                    <li>Thomas Auburn - editing deliverables and assisting with implementation</li>
                    <li>Ryan Early - Risks and editing deliverables</li>
                    <li>Inna Strogonova - Architecture, editing  and adding to deliverables, website</li>
                    <li>Daniel Pearce - Implementation</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How the team works</h4>
                <p>We have organised our team by trying to work through one or two deliverables 
                at a time as a group and discussing how best to complete the task based on the 
                lecture slides for that deliverable combined with the descriptions of how marks 
                are allocated. We used the “eng1 team assessment” pdf that describes specifically 
                what must be included in each section of the deliverable in “3.3.1 Deliverables for 
                Assessment 1” as well as specifying the number of pages required for each segment 
                of the deliverable. We also have been reading over each other’s writing as we are 
                working on the same areas at the same time which allows each member of the team to 
                have a clear understanding of the area we are writing about, allowing members of the 
                team to easily ask questions to each other without confusion of the topic or explanation 
                of what they are talking about. As we complete a deliverable we go back to the topic and 
                insure that any changes we decided are reflected in it so that it accurately displays our 
                current intentions, this allows us to leave areas blank that we are not currently sure about
                 how to complete or areas that we can only decide how to fill after completing a later task .
                 This method is appropriate for our team and for the project as a whole because it clearly 
                 outlines what must  be submitted for each section of each deliverable and allows us a clear 
                 understanding of what is expected. It also gives us an easier time deciding what we must 
                 include in each segment as a blueprint for what we are writing.</p>

                 <h3 id="five2">Software Engineering method</h4>
                 <p>As a software development framework for our project we chose an agile method Scrum. Agile 
                    development focuses on delivering work in small, frequent increments, its approaches are 
                    easy to learn and sufficiently documented. It is suitable for small teams working in a flexible 
                    environment and, therefore, for our engineering project. In Scrum, development is divided into 
                    short ‘sprints’ preceded by sprint planning where the goal of a sprint is decided and followed 
                    by sprint reviews where the result of a sprint is inspected. The methodology also features daily 
                    scrums – short meetings where team members discuss what is done and what is yet to be done. 
                    There are several reasons why we opted for Scrum. To start with, Scrum acknowledges that the team 
                    does not know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience, which fits 
                    in with our team project as we continuously learn and research in order to complete relevant parts 
                    of the project. Scrum is also known to be simple, straightforward, and easy to implement. In addition, 
                    quick releases keep the team motivated throughout the development process.</p>

                <h3 id="ten">How plans changed over the project</h3>
                <p>Our schedule for our implementation was shifted backwards a couple of weeks due to issues with uploading 
                code to Github and difficulty communicating with members of the team which caused difficulty beginning the implementation process.</p>
                <p>During our customer meetings we asked several questions about the requirements and what exactly was needed in order to successfully 
                complete the project. One of the areas that they informed us should be added was a Demo feature of the game where it would run a 
                pre-scripted game to be demonstrated on repeat during open days for potential students to view.</p>
                <p>We were originally going to include all diagrams on the documents themselves but we discovered that they would fill up too much of 
                the page count of the deliverables. Due to this we asked our customer if we could include the diagrams outside of the deliverables 
                themselves and link to them on the page which was accepted. For the rest of the schedule we remained on track, completing the main 
                deliverables that were not dependent on the implementation on schedule.</p>
