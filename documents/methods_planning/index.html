                <h3 id="three">Justification of communication methods</h3>
                <h4>Discord</h4>
                <p>We choose to use Discord for general communication and text messaging as it has 
                a lot of useful features such as voice communication and text messaging as well 
                as creating specific rooms for different projects. We choose Discord instead of 
                other applications such as Slack because more of the team has past experience using 
                Discord.</p>
                <h4>Email</h4>
                <p>We are using Email to communicate with Lecturers to arrange Customer meetings and 
                also to setup initial communication between our team members. In addition, messages 
                that have been sent and received can be stored and searched through safely and easily.</p>
                <h4>Zoom</h4>
                <p>We are using Zoom as it allows us to have contact with the Lecturers (Customers) 
                while in a Practical session. It also has the options to chat, share screen, 
                documents and whiteboard - everything needed for team meetings</p>
                <h4>Google Drive</h4>
                <p>Google Drive provides an easy way to collaboratively work on files as a team and 
                be able to see changes live. It provides an option to create a safe backup of our 
                files and documentation on edits and changes made over time. It also allows us to 
                control the level of access to shared documents.</p>
                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <p>Used to host the code for the game. This service stores code/files using Git 
                repositories which allows for version control and collaborative work. It also 
                has an issue tracker that allows us to flag issues to be fixed and discussed.</p>

                <h3 id="four">Justification of tools used</h3>
                <h4>Game engine</h4>
                <p>The game engine we have decided to use is called LibGDX. We are using this game 
                engine because it provides an open source framework for the game to be built on 
                providing some of the important features that we require as well as having multiple 
                tutorials for its use online.</p>
                <h4>Gradle build tools</h4>
                <p>Build tools are used to automate the building of the software and manage dependencies 
                (such as the game engine library), among other reasons. We are using Gradle because we 
                will likely use LibGDX which is designed for this build system.</p>
                <h4>IDE of choice</h4>
                <p>The IDE that each team member uses doesn't matter much as long as it has modern 
                tooling and supports our chosen build system.</p>

                <h3 id="five">Team organisation</h3>
                <h4>Team roles</h4>
                <ul class="b">
                    <li>Michael Beal</li>
                    <li>Lucas Solomon</li>
                    <li>Thomas Auburn</li>
                    <li>Ryan Early</li>
                    <li>Inna Strogonova</li>
                    <li>Daniel Pearce</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How the team works</h4>
                <p>We have organised our team by trying to work through one or two deliverables 
                at a time as a group and discussing how best to complete the task based on the 
                lecture slides for that deliverable combined with the descriptions of how marks 
                are allocated. We used the “eng1 team assessment” pdf that describes specifically 
                what must be included in each section of the deliverable in “3.3.1 Deliverables for 
                Assessment 1” as well as specifying the number of pages required for each segment 
                of the deliverable. We also have been reading over each other’s writing as we are 
                working on the same areas at the same time which allows each member of the team to 
                have a clear understanding of the area we are writing about, allowing members of the 
                team to easily ask questions to each other without confusion of the topic or explanation 
                of what they are talking about. As we complete a deliverable we go back to the topic and 
                insure that any changes we decided are reflected in it so that it accurately displays our 
                current intentions, this allows us to leave areas blank that we are not currently sure about
                 how to complete or areas that we can only decide how to fill after completing a later task .
                 This method is appropriate for our team and for the project as a whole because it clearly 
                 outlines what must  be submitted for each section of each deliverable and allows us a clear 
                 understanding of what is expected. It also gives us an easier time deciding what we must 
                 include in each segment as a blueprint for what we are writing.</p>
