                <p>To build an abstract and a concrete representation of the architecture, we used UML (Unified Modelling Language) - 
                  a standardized modelling language consisting of a set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers 
                  for specifying, visualizing, and constructing the artifacts of software systems</p>

                <h4 class="arch">1) Sequence diagram</h4>
                <p>The aim of this diagram is to show how objects interact with each other in a particular scenario, namely, to represent 
                  an attempt of a player to arrest infiltrators or other such scenarios. During this time, we weren’t set on whether we could 
                  arrest the enemies while their ability is active.</p>

                <h4 class="arch">2) State diagram</h4>
                <p>This state diagram expresses the different states of the game, such as the main menu, mode selection screen, pause menu, and more. 
                  To construct the state diagram, we used a web diagramming tool known as Creately.</p>

                <h4 class="arch">3) Class diagram</h4>
                <p>We have used a UML(Unified Modelling Language) class diagram. We used it to represent the abstract architecture of the game and it 
                  was produced using GenMyModel.</p>
                <p>We initially started our architecture design using large amounts of inheritance; after all, it seemed natural to have static and 
                  dynamic classes that inherited from an entity class - the static objects would be static and the dynamic objects would be dynamic. 
                  However, we soon started to run into issues. For example, when we started planning how the architecture would allow for different AI
                  behaviour depending on the type of ability the enemy had. We would need to exchange information across different inheritance levels.</p>
                <p>As a result (and with the help of the lectures), we switched to another type of architecture, the entity-component system. This would 
                  allow us to implement the behaviour we wanted within specialised components, making the implementation and maintenance of such code more 
                  manageable.</p>
                <p>The more we looked into this type of architecture, the more it made sense. In this architecture, (almost) everything is an entity and 
                  then functionality can be added to them via components. Additionally, any component functionality that is dependent on other components 
                  can be implemented using the getComponent/getComponents functions on the entity class, allowing a component to get another if it is 
                  required for operation.</p>
                <p>Regardless, this architecture model reduced the architectural complexity compared to our previous architecture.</p>
