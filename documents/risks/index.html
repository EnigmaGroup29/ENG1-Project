        <h3 id="one">Introduction and justification</h3>
        <p>Risks have been identified by looking through our plan for each section then 
        figuring out and discussing what could potentially go wrong. If a new potential 
        risk is identified it will be posted in the Discord “risk-management channel” 
        by a member, discussed in a meeting and then added to the risk table.</p>
        <p>For our risk table we have decided to use project, product, people and technology 
        as possible categories for each risk. “Project” is for issues that will affect the 
        schedule of the project when there’s no better category. “Product” is for any issues 
        that affect the game (our product) in terms of quality. “People” is for any issues that 
        are caused directly by a lack of members for whatever reason. “Technology” is any 
        software or hardware issue.</p>
        <p>We have decided to represent severity and likelihood using a scale of low, medium 
        and high alongside colour coding the cells with <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="orange">orange</span> and <span class="red">red</span> respectively. 
        This was used rather than a large number scale for minimal confusion and an easy to 
        read table. It also makes the more serious risks easy to identify and to indicate 
        priority if multiple issues should occur. The colour coding helps to quickly identify 
        levels of risk at a glance.<p>
        <p>For risks that are low or easy to manage/prevent they have been assigned to all
         members as they don’t require a dedicated owner. For more specific/technical 
         issues, they’ve been assigned to specific members or small groups that are working 
         on parts related to the issue as it’s more efficient to have them check and so it 
         doesn’t disrupt the workflow of other members.</p>
        <p>If a risk occurs in the future, the plan is for a member(s) of the group to report 
        it in the “risk-management” channel of the group’s Discord and bring it up during a meeting. 
        The member(s) responsible for the risk will then work to mitigate the issue. In a situation 
        where this is for some reason impossible alternatives will be discussed.</p>
