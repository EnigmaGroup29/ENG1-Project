                <h3 id="one">SSON</h3>
                <p>Our system is to create the game called Auber. This game is about a 
                constable of a space station who needs to find and arrest aliens who are 
                sabotaging the space station. The program is going to be shown on open days 
                to prospective students.</p>
                <h3 id="two">How we decided our requirements</h3>
                <p>We decided our requirements based on the product brief provided to us at 
                the beginning of the project alongside multiple customer meetings and discussion
                 with the group. The product brief was split into multiple sections which where 
                 the description of the game and the goals, the bullet pointed customer 
                 requirements and finally the constraints we had to follow during the project. 
                 The requirements were decided using both the description of the game in the first 
                 paragraph and also the individually bullet pointed list of specific features at the 
                 bottom of the main paragraph which described the basics of what our game must include.
                  We had to look through the description of the game to get a good idea of the more 
                  specific requirements that were not mentioned in the bullet points. To get the final 
                  customer requirements we carried out several customer meetings and were informed that 
                  we should also include a demo feature of the game that should be running on open days 
                  or other events that would demonstrate a scripted game that shows how the game operates
                   as if a player was playing it at the time. Based on these customer requirements we 
                   needed to decide our functional requirements and non-functional requirements and 
                   decided to layout our decisions in 3 separate tables as described in the “Requirements
                    Engineering” pdf document. We decided to use this method to display our Requirements 
                    as it allowed us to easily view the different types of requirements and how they 
                    interacted with each other and due to the table format we could simply organize our 
                    requirements including the relevant information for each type.</p>
